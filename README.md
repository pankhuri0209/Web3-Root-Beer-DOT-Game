# WEB3 ROOTBEER .DOT GAME

WEB3 ROOTBEER DOT GAME is the Web 3 implementation of the supply chain excellence (originally ideated at MIT in 1960 and then developed in web2 by Harvard Publishing) that opens up a new avenue in Web 3 gaming for RWA @ scale for supply chain financing.

## About the Project

As a step in increasing WEB3 scale, both consumer small businesses, and  institutions want to enter the supply chain /trade financing space, which is documented to be a 2-3 trillion-dollar gap in supply chain finance in developing countries. 

They need high scale low barrier to validations for business geniune-ness, credit worthiness, their contributions in heritage occupations and biodiversity and SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE , which are items that NFTs can move beyond crypto native collectibles.

## What is Rootbeer game:

WEB3 ROOTBEER DOT GAME is the Web 3 implementation of the supply chain excellence (originally ideated at MIT in 1960 and then developed in web2 by Harvard Publishing) that opens up a new avenue in Web 3 gaming for RWA @ scale for supply chain financing. 

This game develops skills in training but also improves operational efficiencies of supply chains by helping to identify and reduce Bullwhip effect.

## What is Bullwhip effect: 
A small variation in demand near the demand end, can amplify in to larger demand / supply fluctuations as information passes from Retailer to Wholesaler to Distributor to Manufacturer. 

## What does Bullwhip do:
Bullwhips distort demand by reducing transparency on true demand and supply. They destroy financial planning and upsets cashflow optimization, the life blood of micro, small, medium enterprises who run more than 90% of world economdy.

Though widely taught( in management schools and corporations, governments ), the current Web 2 version of the Root Beer game, though theoretically explained, is limited in actually showing them in actual decentralized network operations. Most Web2 systems are structurally constrained to only work well with adjacent nodes, which distorts demand, and centralized third-party solutions do not work well for business trust reasons.

## The RootBeer DOT GAME is the Web 3 enhanced implementation 
    to extend NFTs beyond cyrpto-native concepts to RWAs and institutional Defi at scale for supply chain/trade financing 
    through NFT badges to identify high quality instruments to finance, based on reputation, and operational excellence badges, 
    developed on DOT on the unique NFT architecture. 

    Goals of the game 
    to train on advanced web3 based trust minimized full visibility supply chains
    reduce bull whip effect
    
## These NFT badges serve as validation risk reduction indicators for financiers. 

## IMPACT: Web 3 RootBeer game 
    ## democratizes the training and accelerate brand, operational excellence NFTs 
    ## to extend beyond cyrpto native collectibles to RWA tokenization of instruments 
    ## such as Nativity, BioDiversity, Badges, Local heritage occupation / worker NFTs,  Proof of membership in high performance supply chains 
    ## to broaden access to funding.  
    
## Opening up PLAY to MANAGE and PLAY to FINANCE RWA themes.

## Features


![UniqueNFTArch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc93fa7-1261-4237-a4fc-d97da0a1aed9)

The project is developed using the NFT Architecture in Unique network in OPAL Testnet

## Tech Stack

UniqueNetwork
React.js
Node.js
SUBwallet - OPL

## Unique Network

Key Features that the project needed that were available in the Unique network

    High volume Low Cost NFTs for 
        Brand, Compliance NFTS : for Nativity, Heritage Badges etc
        Modelling Team level structures - Nested NFTs
            Team consisting of vertically integrated supply chains - This specifically fits within the scheme of persenting Network operational Excellence NFTs in Deep supply chains
        Dynamic NFTs : To keep scores at the individual and team levels.
        Customizing NFTS : To show operational excellence by proof of participation in high performance supply chains and badges 

    For the purpose of RWA instruments for supply chain financing.


These features help highlight the accomplishement NFTs for global optimization traits as opposed to local optimization and earn network operations excellence badges.


Game Structure:

The information is set up for anonymized data share, and as 2 teams

## Default:
Team 1 - that plays in conventional ( web 2 mode ) - visibility to just adjacent nodes
Team 2 - that plays in fully chain transparency

Further extensions will include

## Extensions to more than 2 teams with deep composabiltiy
## Multi-chain parachains
## ZK for proof abstractions off-chain
## Integration to Risk Assessment Frameworks and value underwriting
## Integration to Institutional Defi / Defi
