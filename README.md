# WEB3 ROOTBEER .DOT GAME

WEB3 ROOTBEER DOT GAME is the Web 3 implementation of the supply chain excellence (originally ideated at MIT in 1960 and then developed in web2 by Harvard Publishing) that opens up a new avenue in Web 3 gaming for RWA @ scale for supply chain financing.

## About the Project

As a step in increasing WEB3 scale, both consumer small businesses, and  institutions want to enter the supply chain /trade financing space, which is documented to be a 2-3 trillion-dollar gap in supply chain finance in developing countries. 

They need high scale low barrier to validations for business geniune-ness, credit worthiness, their contributions in heritage occupations and biodiversity and SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE , which are items that NFTs can move beyond crypto native collectibles.

## What is Rootbeer game:

WEB3 ROOTBEER DOT GAME is the Web 3 implementation of the supply chain excellence (originally ideated at MIT in 1960 and then developed in web2 by Harvard Publishing) that opens up a new avenue in Web 3 gaming for RWA @ scale for supply chain financing. 

This game develops skills in training but also improves operational efficiencies of supply chains by helping to identify and reduce Bullwhip effect.

## What is Bullwhip effect: 
A small variation in demand near the demand end, can amplify in to larger demand / supply fluctuations as information passes from Retailer to Wholesaler to Distributor to Manufacturer. The cost of individual entities include 
             Inventory carrying cost ( Modelled at USD 1 per unit of inventory every week )
             Stockout costs          ( Modelled at USD 2 per unit of stockout every week )

             
## Game Structure:

The information is set up for anonymized data share, and as 2 teams

## Default:
Team 1 - that plays in conventional ( web 2 mode ) - visibility to just adjacent nodes ( BLIND to true demand - A key issue in centralized systems ).
Team 2 - that plays in fully chain transparency. ( facilitated by WEb 3 and DAG s as trust-minimized peer to peer solutions )

## Assumption:
The set up is a nested supply chain. There is a delay ( 2 weeks of lead time from the point of ordering)

## The Goal:
The game simulation runs for of X number of weeks 
The goal is to reduce the bull whip effect for your entire supply chain - NOT jusf for your company.

## The key aspect of the game is individual scores does not matter, it is the team's score that matter. Team with the lowest bullwhip score wins, and carries the NFT badges. 
## Proof of membership in high performance chains are  CASH FLOW VALIDATIONS Institutional Defi is looking for. This increases the predictabiltiy for the financiers.

## What does Bullwhip do ?
Bullwhips distort demand by reducing transparency on true demand and supply. They destroy financial planning and upsets cashflow optimization, the life blood of micro, small, medium enterprises who run more than 90% of world economy. This unpredictabilty increases the validation risk for high volume stable financiers. Hence global SMEs have to resort to local most times predatory lending.

## Current Limitations
Though widely taught( in management schools and corporations, governments ), the current Web 2 version of the Root Beer game, though theoretically explained, is limited in actually showing them in actual decentralized network operations. Most Web2 systems are structurally constrained to only work well with adjacent nodes, which distorts demand, and centralized third-party solutions do not work well for business trust reasons.

## The RootBeer DOT GAME is the Web 3 enhanced implementation 
    to extend NFTs beyond cyrpto-native concepts to RWAs and institutional Defi at scale for supply chain/trade financing 
    through NFT badges to identify high quality instruments to finance, based on reputation, and operational excellence badges, 
    developed on DOT on the unique NFT architecture. 

    Goals of the game 
    to train on advanced web3 based trust minimized full visibility supply chains
    reduce bull whip effect
    
## These NFT badges serve as validation risk reduction indicators for financiers. 

## IMPACT: Web 3 RootBeer game 
    ## democratizes the training and accelerate brand, operational excellence NFTs 
    ## to extend beyond cyrpto native collectibles to RWA tokenization of instruments 
    ## such as Nativity, BioDiversity, Badges, Local heritage occupation / worker NFTs,  Proof of membership in high performance supply chains 
    ## to broaden access to funding.  
    
## Opening up PLAY to MANAGE and PLAY to FINANCE RWA themes.

## Features

![UniqueNFTArch](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6cc93fa7-1261-4237-a4fc-d97da0a1aed9)

The project is developed using the NFT Architecture in Unique network in OPAL Testnet

## Tech Stack
  UniqueNetwork
  React.js
  Node.js
  SUBwallet - OPL

## Unique Network

Key Features that the project needed that were available in the Unique network

    High volume Low Cost NFTs for 
        Brand, Compliance NFTS : for Nativity, Heritage Badges etc
        Modelling Team level structures - Nested NFTs
            Team consisting of vertically integrated supply chains - This specifically fits within the scheme of persenting Network operational Excellence NFTs in Deep supply chains
        Dynamic NFTs : To keep scores at the individual and team levels.
        Customizing NFTS : To show operational excellence by proof of participation in high performance supply chains and badges 

    For the purpose of RWA instruments for supply chain financing.

These features help highlight the accomplishement NFTs for global optimization traits as opposed to local optimization and earn network operations excellence badges.

## Further extensions will include
  ##Extensions to more than 2 teams with deep composabiltiy
  ##Multi-chain integrations
  ##ZK for proof abstractions off-chain
  ##Integration to Risk Assessment Frameworks and value underwriting
  ##Integration to Institutional Defi / Defi
